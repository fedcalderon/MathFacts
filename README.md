# Math Facts
Welcome to Math Facts Practice! This app helps you or your child practice math facts using randomly generated problems. Math Facts includes exercises for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more, based on the user's age and grade level. 100 problems are shown one at a time, and the user may enter a response using either a keyboard or mouse. After completing a test, the program shows all the problems and displays which ones the user answered correctly or incorrectly. You will have the ability to print the results or save them for future reference. You may view all completed tests as well as helpful tips on the reports screen.
