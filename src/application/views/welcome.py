# This is the welcome screen for all developers to collaborate
# Need to decide on a common screen dimension for the program
# Investigate if you have a master frame or screen, that changes content for each page
# Program should have the ability to resize at will (stop at a minimum size), and full screen

# 3: Andrew: Description of the program, graphics
# 4: Milton: Link to terms of use (needs a new page)
