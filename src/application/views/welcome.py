# This is the welcome screen for all developers to collaborate
# Need to decide on a common screen dimension for the program
# Investigate if you have a master frame or screen, that changes content for each page
# Program should have the ability to resize at will (stop at a minimum size), and full screen

# 1: Micah: Design, a nice picture, colors, a logo
# 2: Xade: Place the login and registration links, nice animation
# 3: Andrew: Description of the program, graphics
# 4: Milton: Link to terms of use (needs a new page)
# 5: Asher: Test the connection between the login and registration pages, testing all the code
# Team lead: Asher
